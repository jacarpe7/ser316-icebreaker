So there I was, sitting in the biergarten deep in a kopfkino.
I was driving my BMW in rainy day. And in this dream, I thought, heck, I think I'll try to crash through the luftschloss wettbewerbsfaehig.  
Right before crashing I was abruptly brought out of my haze by my waitress, who said my Bratwurst not done yet.
I was a bit upset, because I knew that I was running out of time to get to the Flughafen, and I'd rather not go hungry. 
I put on my Dirndel and my tight lederhose, my typical Flughafen attire. 
The waitress delivered my Brat with Brot on the side, apologizing for the wait, I replied "There is not time for apologies." as I slid the still piping Brat into my tight lederhosen pocket and sprinted for the door.
This may sound like such a schnapsidee, but it was genius! I used the klimaanlage while I drove!
Heading down the hauptstrasse, I was distracted by my ever-cooling bratwurst and its oozing juices. As I looked up, I had to swerve to miss what looked like Schneewittchen, however I did not react fast enough. It was the waitress!
I was listning Musik while hading down the haupstrasses and someone got me out of my luftschloss in the biergarten.
