So there I was, sitting in a the biergarten deep in a kopkino.
I was driving my BMW in rainy day. And in this dream, I thought, heck, I think I'll try to crash through the luftschloss wettbewerbsfaehig.  
Right before crashing I was abruptly brought out of my haze by my waitress, who said my Bratwurst not done yet.
I was a bit upset, because I knew that I was running out of time to get to the Flughafen, and I'd rather not go hungry. 
I put on my Dirndel and my tight lederhose, my typical Flughafen attire.
